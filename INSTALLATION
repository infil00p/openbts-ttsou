Installation Requirements



OpenBTS compiles to a simple Unix binary and does not require special installation.

To run OpenBTS, the following should be installed:

	Asterisk (http://www.asterisk.org), running SIP on port 5060.

	libosip (http://www.gnu.org/software/osip/)

	libusrp (http://gnuradio.org).  This is part of the GNURadio installation.  It is the only part used by OpenBTS.


For information on specific executables, see tests/README.tests and apps/README.apps.
