Welcome to the OpenBTS source code.


These are the directories:

AsteriskConfig	Asterisk configuration files for use with OpenBTS.
CommonLib	Common-use libraries, mostly C++ wrappers for basic facilities.
Control		Control-layer functions for the protocols of GSM 04.08 and SIP.
GSM		The GSM stack.
SIP		Components of the SIP state machines ued by the control layer.
TRXManager	The interface between the GSM stack and the radio.
Transceiver	The software transceiver and specific installation tests.
apps		OpenBTS application binaries.
doc		Project documentation.
tests		Test fixtures for subsets of OpenBTS components.



OpenBTS uses the following UDP port assignments:

5060 -- Asterisk
5061 -- reserved for local SIP softphone
5062 -- OpenBTS SIP interface
5063 -- reserved for local SIMPLE server
5700-range -- OpenBTS-transceiver interface

These can be controlled in the configuration file, apps/OpenBTS.config.
